Before you start, set up an environment in which to run the Jupyter notebook `Convolutional.ipynb`:

```
$ conda create -n tf python==3.7 tensorflow jupyter matplotlib tqdm nomkl
$ conda activate tf
$ conda install -c conda-forge jupyterthemes
```

The `nomkl` package is only required on some Macs to avoid an error on those systems. Now you can start by running

```
$ jupyter notebook
```
